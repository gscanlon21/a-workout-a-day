7	\N	0	Dips	When you descend into a triceps dip, using poor form, it also increases the risk of shoulder impingement. Impingement is a condition where the ligaments, tendons, and bursa that run underneath the acromion, the bony prominence on the shoulder blade, become compressed. The end result is inflammation and discomfort, especially when you do dips or when you lift your arms up. That’s why form is so critical when you dip.	0

172	The internal rotation to which you expose your shoulders is one of the most harmful exercises you can do, causing similar damage to triceps dips. As a demonstration, hold your arms straight out to your sides with your palms facing down.\n\nThen, rotate your hands forward as if pouring out, or emptying a glass of water in from each hand. Then, to do the upright row, you’ll lift the barbell with bent elbows causing internal rotation of the shoulders.\n\nInternal rotation itself is not necessarily harmful to your shoulders.\n\nThe problem comes as you raise your arms and add resistance (the weight of the barbell) in that position. Every time you raise your arms bearing the weight, impingement occurs. That involves a small shoulder tendon getting pinched by the bones in your shoulder.	0	Upright Rows	\N	0

28	Be mindful of your posture throughout the day, and realign yourself regularly.	\N	2
27	Paying attention to posture can help you look and feel better.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/posture-and-back-health	2
195	Research teams from Harvard and elsewhere found that people who practiced yoga improved two markers of frailty — walking speed and the ability to get up from a chair — compared with people who didn't practice yoga.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/harvard-led-study-yoga-fights-frailty	1
17	Be aware that training too hard or too often can cause overuse injuries like stress fractures, stiff or sore joints and muscles, and inflamed tendons and ligaments.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/10-tips-for-exercising-safely	1
18	Choose clothes and shoes designed for your type of exercise. Replace shoes or insoles as the cushioning wears out.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/10-tips-for-exercising-safely	1
26	You body is meant to move. Shift positions, or get up to move around every hour of the day.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/why-you-should-move-even-just-a-little-throughout-the-day	1
46	Reward yourself after achieving special workout related milestones. Nothing motivates like success!	\N	16
287	On the days people drank coffee, they took an average of 1,000 extra steps per day. But they slept about 36 fewer minutes per night, on average.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/does-coffee-help-or-harm-your-heart	8
146	Adults who stay well-hydrated appear to be healthier, develop fewer chronic conditions, such as heart and lung disease, and live longer than those who may not get sufficient fluids.	https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/good-hydration-linked-healthy-aging	8
139	The risk of injury increases by up to 70 percent when young athletes get less than eight hours of sleep.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25028798/	4
140	As the years pass, muscle mass in the body generally shrinks, and strength and power decline. Sarcope­nia—defined as age-related muscle loss—can begin at around age 35 and occurs at a rate of 1-2 percent a year for the typical person. Studies suggest that strength and power training can help reverse these effects and restore muscle function.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/strength-and-power-training-for-older-adults#excerpt	1
90	The Shavasana pose is a great way to relax and relieve tension in the body after a workout.	\N	1
68	Incorporate strength into your everyday life: Squat instead of bending over; Squat up from a seated position; Take the stairs; Use a standing desk; Sit on an exercise ball; Walk with ankle weights/a weighted vest; Ride a bike to local restaurants.	\N	1
93	For the best strength gain, lift weights at around 60-80% of your 1 rep max (the most weight you can safely lift for 1 rep in good form). Perform reps until muscle failure or until you can no longer maintain good form.	https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness/how-to-build-strength-guide	1
95	Protein is an important macronutrient essential for muscle protein synthesis (MPS), muscle growth and function.	https://www.verywellfit.com/muscle-protein-synthesis-and-muscle-growth-4148337	1
97	Vitamin D is crucial for adequate calcium absorbtion necessary to create strong, healthy bones.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/essential-nutrients-your-body-needs-for-building-bone	1
16	Take five to 10 minutes to warm up and cool down properly.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/10-tips-for-exercising-safely	1
19	For strength training, good form is essential. Initially use no weight, or very light weights, when learning the exercises.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/10-tips-for-exercising-safely	1
20	Watch for signs of overheating, such as headache, dizziness, nausea, faintness, cramps, or palpitations.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/10-tips-for-exercising-safely	1
21	If you stop exercising for a while, drop back to a lower level of exercise initially.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/10-tips-for-exercising-safely	1
22	Plan to start slowly and boost your activity level gradually unless you are already exercising frequently and vigorously.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/10-tips-for-exercising-safely	1
37	Never sacrifice good form by hurrying to finish reps or sets, or struggling to lift heavier weights.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/10-tips-for-exercising-safely	1
38	Listen to your body. Hold off on exercise when you're feeling faint, fatigued or suffer persistent aches and pains in joints after exercising.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/10-tips-for-exercising-safely	1
39	Stretch only to the point of mild tension, never to the point of pain.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/six-tips-for-safe-stretches	1
40	Breathe comfortably and continuously while stretching.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/six-tips-for-safe-stretches	1
41	It is tempting to avoid the motions that cause you discomfort. But limiting your movements can weaken muscles and make compound joint trouble worse.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/exercise-an-effective-prescription-for-joint-pain	1
44	Don't be discouraged if you stop for a while. Everybody needs a holiday. Get started again gradually and work up to your old pace.	https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/getting-active/getting-started---tips-for-long-term-exercise-success	1
45	Use music or audio books to keep you entertained while you workout.	\N	1
49	As you start out, it's best to build muscle endurance with high reps and low sets. As you progress, use higher weights with lower reps and more sets to build strength.	\N	1
52	To increase muscular endurance, rest for 30 seconds or less between sets.	https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/how-long-should-you-rest-between-sets.html	1
53	To increase hypertrophy (muscle mass), rest for 30-90 seconds between sets.	https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/how-long-should-you-rest-between-sets.html	1
54	To increase strength and power, rest for 2-5 minutes between sets.	https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/how-long-should-you-rest-between-sets.html	1
29	Breathe deeply. You are in the present moment.	\N	64
30	Bring awareness into the moment.	\N	64
25	You are awesome!	\N	128
66	Sitting at a desk? Consider seated calf raises (with ankle weights) to strengthen the lower legs.	\N	1
67	Standing at a desk? Consider standing calf raises (with a weighted vest or ankle weights) to strengthen the lower legs.	\N	1
71	By sitting all day, you’re not depending on your powerful lower body muscles to hold you up. This leads to muscle atrophy, which is the weakening of these muscles. Without strong leg and glute muscles to stabilize you, your body is at risk of injury.	https://www.healthline.com/health/workplace-health/things-that-happen-when-you-sit-down-all-day	1
72	For increased stability work, try switching out a bench or chair for an exercise ball.	\N	1
83	Hold onto pullup bars or fitness rings using your fingers. This will help build better grip strength and will help prevent calluses from your palm slipping down the bar.	https://stronglifts.com/pullups/	1
85	Even mild dehydration can lead to increased post-workout fatigue and pain. Most people underestimate the amount of water they lose through sweat.	https://www.strongerbyscience.com/research-spotlight-dehydration/	1
173	Focus on form, not weight. Align your body correctly and move smoothly through each exercise. Poor form can prompt injuries and slow gains.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/7-tips-for-a-safe-and-successful-strength-training-program	1
172	Working at the right tempo helps you stay in control rather than compromise strength gains through momentum. For example, count to three while lowering a weight, hold, then count to three while raising it to the starting position.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/7-tips-for-a-safe-and-successful-strength-training-program	1
59	Expose your eyes to natural light.	\N	2
56	A truly ergonomic workstation is one that you regularly push away from.	\N	2
84	Look away from screens and squeeze your eyes shut periodically to maintain good eye health.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/electronic-screen-alert-avoid-this-vision-risk	2
192	Practicing everyday mindfulness can also improve your memory and concentration skills and help you feel less distracted and better able to manage crises.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/evoking-calm-practicing-mindfulness-in-daily-life-helps-202110142617	2
87	Muscle length and strength between opposing muscle groups need to be in balance for normal movement and function.	https://www.healthline.com/health/muscle-imbalance	1
98	One of the most important contributors to muscular growth is the tension that muscle fibers experience under load. Want to buff a certain muscle? Squeeze it throughout the exercise.	https://www.ironmaster.com/blog/importance-of-muscular-tension-for-maximized-workouts/	1
100	If you struggle to maintain good form during an exercise, drop back to an easier variation of the exercise to build those stabilizing muscles necessary for good form.	\N	1
105	The last few difficult repetitions, when the speed of movement slows down due to fatigue, are important for creating adaptation.	https://human-movement.com/why-reps-and-sets-for-injury-rehab-are-not-important/	1
108	Never sacrifice quality for quantity.	\N	1
120	It's recommended to get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week.	https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/adults/index.htm	1
121	Bend at the hips and knees, not at the waist.	https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=1&contentid=4456	1
123	Isometric strength training develops strength that is extremely specific to the range of motion trained. This can be helpful in training weak points. For example, isometric holds in the bottom of a squat (pause squats), or isometric deadlift holds just above or below your sticking point can help bust plateaus.	https://thebarbellphysio.com/ultimate-guide-hamstring-strain-rehabilitation/	1
125	Injured muscle tissue responds much better to gentle exercise and movement than it does vigorous stretching.	https://www.physio-network.com/blog/stretch-muscle-strain/	1
122	Think of exercise as medicine – you need to follow the prescription to reap the benefits. Don't neglect exercise, but don't go overboard either. Moderation is key.	\N	1
130	You tear muscle fibers in the gym and repair/grow stronger muscle while you rest. Recovery time is incredibly crucial to a fitness regimen.	https://www.healthline.com/health/muscle-recovery	1
131	A full night's sleep gives your body time to recover, conserve energy, and repair and build up the muscles worked during exercise.	https://www.acefitness.org/resources/everyone/blog/7818/7-benefits-of-sleep-for-exercise-recovery/	1
132	Hard training imposes a large stress on the body and the fatigue you accumulate can mask your gains. A period of reduced training (or tapering) can help you recover, reduce your stress, and reveal the strength you gained during your hard training cycle.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/why-am-i-so-tired-after-exercising	1
141	Self-monitoring diet and weight increases self-awareness, and this has been shown to positively influence eating and exercise behaviors.	https://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/Fulltext/2006/01000/Self_Monitoring__Influencing_Effective_Behavior.7.aspx	1
143	Tendons lag behind muscles by 2-5 years in their strength adaptation – depending on how one uses them. Don’t push harder or increase your loads at a rate faster than what your tendons can adapt to.	Dr. Nikita A. Vizniak	1
47	When life gives you lemons, stick them on your barbell. Conquer life's lemons!	\N	16
89	Exercise is considered the most effective, non-drug treatment for reducing pain and improving movement in people with arthritis.	https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/healthy-living/physical-activity/getting-started/benefits-of-exercise-for-osteoarthritis	4
142	Muscle and tendon injuries tend to occur when the muscle is overloaded, especially in a lengthened position. Eccentric exercises load the muscle while it is getting longer. This type of training has been shown to help prevent injuries.	https://foreverfitscience.com/workout-programs/eccentric-exercises/	4
145	Large volumes of predominantly plyometric training, such as sports, may lead to imbalances in muscle and tendon properties and eventually result in injury. An imbalance in muscle and tendon properties can be prevented by regularly performing heavy resistance training.	https://www.basvanhooren.com/imbalances-in-muscle-and-tendon-strength-and-the-relation-with-injuries-and-performance/	1
48	Be better, not bitter.	\N	32
42	Enjoy the simple things.	\N	64
147	When you think about your body as a garden, it’s almost ludicrous to even consider the idea of forcing some type of adaptation. All you can do is nurture it and provide it with the best conditions for growth. You fertilize it, tend the soil, uproot the weeds, water it, leave it in the sunlight, and give it the best conditions for growth. It will only grow as well as its circumstances allow. That’s a much more accurate metaphor for how training works.	Greg Nuckols	1
171	When learning a strength training routine, many experts suggest starting with no weight, or very light weight. Concentrate on slow, smooth lifts and equally controlled descents while isolating a muscle group.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/7-tips-for-a-safe-and-successful-strength-training-program	1
170	Pay attention to your breathing during your workouts. Exhale as you work against resistance by lifting, pushing, or pulling; inhale as you release.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/7-tips-for-a-safe-and-successful-strength-training-program	1
169	Give muscles time off. Strength training causes tiny tears in muscle tissue. These tears aren't harmful, but they are important: muscles grow stronger as the tears knit up. Always give your muscles at least 48 hours to recover before your next strength training session.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/7-tips-for-a-safe-and-successful-strength-training-program	1
168	Stick with your routine — working all the major muscles of your body two or three times a week is ideal.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/7-tips-for-a-safe-and-successful-strength-training-program	1
167	Keep challenging muscles by slowly increasing weight or resistance. The right weight for you differs depending on the exercise. Choose a weight that tires the targeted muscle or muscles by the last two repetitions while still allowing you to maintain good form. If you can't do the last two reps, choose a lighter weight. When it feels too easy to complete add weight (roughly 1 to 2 pounds for arms, 2 to 5 pounds for legs), or add another set of repetitions to your workout (up to three sets). If you add weight, remember that you should be able to do all the repetitions with good form and the targeted muscles should feel tired by the last two.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/7-tips-for-a-safe-and-successful-strength-training-program	1
166	It's important to know your limits and not exceed them when exercising or participating in physical activities. Proper care of your joints can preserve function in the long term and encourage physical activity.	https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=avoiding-joint-injuries-1-2842	1
162	Keep in shape. A high cardiovascular fitness level is crucial to avoid joint injuries. Otherwise, as you tire your form can fail and your joints carry unbalanced weight.	https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=avoiding-joint-injuries-1-2842	1
161	Never skip your warm-up or cool down. Tight or stiff muscles around a joint will make the area more prone to injury. This is especially important in sports that require quick movements, such as basketball and tennis.	https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=avoiding-joint-injuries-1-2842	1
160	Train smart by cross-training. Repetitive-motion injuries caused by doing just one sport or workout are some of the most common. You can prevent them by doing different sports or activities that work different muscles. For example, if you mostly ride a bike, take a core-strengthening class once a week.	https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=avoiding-joint-injuries-1-2842	1
159	Avoid doing too much, too soon. Never increase the length of your workouts by more than 10 percent from one week to the next, and never increase both the length and intensity of your workout at the same time.	https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=avoiding-joint-injuries-1-2842	1
155	If an exercises causes pain, the solution is simple. Stop doing it, and find a similar one that doesn't. There is no single 'must do' exercise that can't be replaced with something else.	Christian Finn	1
153	Don't exercise immediately after eating.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/stomach-troubles-with-no-clear-cause-heres-what-you-can-do	1
152	Varying exercise selection has a positive effect on enhancing motivation to train, while eliciting similar improvements in muscular adaptations.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6934277/	1
149	Look straight ahead at a distant object when you do unstable exercises. If you look at the floor when you do exercises that challenge your balance and stability, it'll shift your weight forward, putting stress on your lower back.	https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a19548559/best-loaded-carries/	1
150	Back muscles and your core help to stabilize your body. If your core is weak, the other surrounding muscles have to compensate. Over time, these muscles can suffer strain, which leads to lingering pain.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/straight-talk-on-planking-2019111318304	1
148	Reward yourself with a delicious protein shake after a completed workout!	\N	16
154	Adding yoga to aerobic exercise may help lower high blood pressure.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/adding-yoga-to-aerobic-exercise-may-help-lower-high-blood-pressure	4
36	When sitting down, keep your chin parallel to the floor; your shoulders, hips, and knees at even heights; and your knees and feet pointing straight ahead.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/why-good-posture-matters	2
291	Enjoyment for high-intensity interval exercise increases with chronic training.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5156428/pdf/pone.0168534.pdf	4
292	Both unprocessed and processed red meat are linked to higher risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, with no apparent difference in risk between men and women.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/men-women-and-red-meat-risk-maybe-both-sexes-should-put-down-the-burger	8
174	All of my accomplishments matter.	\N	32
32	Take a moment to pause and come back to the present.	\N	64
33	Are you aware? How does your body feel? 	\N	64
61	Take your time and eat some fruit. Slowly. Notice the flavor, the texture, the freshness.	\N	64
127	Enjoy the little things.	\N	64
51	Have a beautiful day!	\N	128
158	Limited ankle mobility manifests itself as a functional limitation in everyday tasks such as walking, negotiating stairs, and even in athletic endeavors such as achieving proper squat depth or cutting.	https://theprehabguys.com/unlock-ankle-mobility/	4
294	Studies show that spending time outdoors can decrease a child's risk of developing myopia.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/curbing-nearsightedness-in-children-can-outdoor-time-help-202212152868	8
317	Berries. From strawberries and blackberries to cranberries and blue­berries, these gemlike fruits are particularly potent in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. Along with fiber and vitamin C, berries possess plant pigment phytochemicals, such as anthocyanins and ellagic acid, which may be behind their health benefits. Studies have linked increased berry consumption with lower risks of heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes.	Harvard Medical School	8
318	Apples. Maybe it's true what they say about an apple a day. A study of nearly 35,000 women, found that consumption of this fruit—along with its relative, pears—was linked with a lower risk of death from heart disease. The star components of apples—fiber, vitamin C, pectin, and polyphenols—have been associated, primarily in animal studies, with anti-inflammatory effects and an increase in beneficial microbes in the gut.	Harvard Medical School	8
319	Stone fruits. Cherries, peaches, apricots, and plums are all examples of stone fruits. These fruits contain fiber, vitamin C, potassium, and a variety of phytochemicals associated with their colors. For example, cherries have garnered the lion's share of the research among stone fruits. Some studies suggest that cherries can reduce pain and soreness after exercise as well as a reduced risk of gout attacks. The high levels of phenolic compounds in cherries, which have been linked to reduced inflammation, may be behind those benefits.	Harvard Medical School	8
194	My workout goals are attainable.	\N	64
290	Waking up earlier is healthier than going to bed later when trying to limit the damage of sleep deprivation.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195666323024583	8
293	The most powerful way to protect the brain is to live a healthy lifestyle. The healthy habits to include are summed up with the acronym SHIELD: Sleep at least seven hours a night, Handle stress, Interact with friends, Exercise daily, Learn new things, and eat a healthy Diet.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/shield-your-brain-from-decline	2
320	Citrus. Oranges, grapefruit, lemons, and limes are famously rich in vitamin C. They also contain fiber, potassium, calcium, B vitamins, copper, and anti-inflammatory phytochemicals such as flavonoids and carotenoids. Though there is little human research on citrus, the nutrients found in citrus fruits have been associated with heart-protective effects.	Harvard Medical School	8
321	Pomegranates. Those tiny pomegranate seeds contain big rewards of vitamins C and K, potassium, fiber, and potent phytochemicals such as anthocyanin and resveratrol. These nutrients may be behind the potential benefits of eating pomegranates.	Harvard Medical School	8
322	Grapes. These succulent fruits are burst­ing with fiber, vitamins C and K, and powerful phytochemicals.	Harvard Medical School	8
1	People who'd averaged at least 12 hours a day sitting were 63% likelier to develop dementia than those who'd spent less than 10 hours daily in a chair. Furthermore, exercise didn't seem to change those odds, since among people who sat for 10 hours or more daily, those who worked out were as prone to dementia as those who exercised very little.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/long-hours-sitting-can-raise-dementia-odds-despite-exercise	8
3	By harnessing the power of vasoconstriction and vasodilation, [cold water] therapies stimulate blood flow, deliver oxygen and nutrients, and remove cellular waste more efficiently.	https://coldplungeculture.com/do-ice-baths-improve-circulation/	8
2	Spending just three hours a day outside soaking up natural light can make a huge difference on vision. It can help lower the risk of children and young adults developing myopia, or nearsightedness as it’s commonly known.	https://www.rebuildyourvision.com/blog/vision-conditions/nearsightedness/natural-light-essential-normal-eye-development	8
176	My best is always good enough.	\N	32
4	An examination of four studies that together included more than 8,600 people found that eating more saturated fat led to a 39% higher risk for Alzheimer's and more than double the risk for dementia in general. For each additional 4 grams per day of saturated fat people consumed, the risk for dementia increased by 15%.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/brain-draining-foods	8
5	Red meat, butter, cream, whole milk. All of these animal-based foods are high in saturated fat, which raises blood levels of unhealthy LDL cholesterol. When cholesterol builds up in arteries, it sets off a chain of events that can ultimately lead to a stroke.	https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/brain-draining-foods	8

Then, the other target is called out. Again, shift your eyes quickly and accurately to the named target. While you are fixated on one target, your helper can move the object that is not being watched to a new location. Then, your helper names the now-stationary target and your eyes should jump directly to that target. Work this eye for 1-3 minutes, then switch to the other eye.	\N	0	2

Because of the weight limitation, I'm keeping the strenghening muscles to minor muscle groups and anti-rotation muscle groups. Back and arm muscles are tagged as stability muscle groups.	459044	renegade-row.jpg	147	0	t	f	1	0	t	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-GMCHG3YlU	107	\N	\N	4096

1673	\N	\N	t	0	2	Prone Shoulder Extension	This exercise, among others, was found by Cools et al (2007) to display the best muscle activation ratios in which the upper trapezius activation is minimized whereas the middle and lower trapezius activation is maximized. The prone and side-lying positions decrease the upper trap's activation as a postural muscle. When you stand, the upper trap is more active as its working against gravity. Laying on your stomach or side eliminates the effects of gravity and can decrease excessive activation of the upper trapezius.\n\nShoulder and neck pain and dysfunction are among some of the most common complaints of the overhead athlete and desk bound worker alike. Recent research has shone light on the importance of the scapular muscles on shoulder/neck pain and dysfunction. The scapula serves as our shoulder's stable base. We need a strong and stabilized scapula in order for our shoulder joint to move properly. Proximal stability promotes distal mobility.\n\nWhen it comes to the scapular muscles, the 3-part trapezius muscle plays a extremely large role in providing this stable base. In those with shoulder/neck pain and dysfunction, it has been found that many times the upper traps are hyperactive whereas the middle and lower trapezius muscles show reduced activation. Along with insufficient serratus anterior activation, this quartet of dysfunctions can lead to decreased amounts of scapular upward rotation, external rotation, and posterior tilt - all specific scapular motions that are imperative to maintaining the subacromial space and preventing things like shoulder impingement and rotator cuff tendinopathy. Start with no weights as shown, then progress to dumbbells.	68719542272	reverse-snow-angels.jpg	137447342144	0	t	f	1	129	f	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWXmznEth6Q	976	\N	\N	58247

The fact that they work the quadriceps and not the hamstrings can lead to an imbalance in the muscles, which heightens the risk of a hamstring or anterior cruciate ligament tear.	f	32	2	Half Squats	\N	1	half-squats.jpg	50333696	0	f	f	1	0	t	https://www.hybridcalisthenics.com/half-squats	3	50	25	7111

560	upright-row.webp	The internal rotation to which you expose your shoulders is one of the most harmful exercises you can do, causing similar damage to triceps dips. As a demonstration, hold your arms straight out to your sides with your palms facing down.\n\nThen, rotate your hands forward as if pouring out, or emptying a glass of water in from each hand. Then, to do the upright row, you’ll lift the barbell with bent elbows causing internal rotation of the shoulders.\n\nInternal rotation itself is not necessarily harmful to your shoulders.\n\nThe problem comes as you raise your arms and add resistance (the weight of the barbell) in that position. Every time you raise your arms bearing the weight, impingement occurs. That involves a small shoulder tendon getting pinched by the bones in your shoulder.	t	8	2	Upright Row	Hand placement should be at minimum shoulder-width apart or there is a risk of shoulder impingement.	133	upright-row.jpg	131170	0	f	t	1	0	t	\N	172	\N	\N	256

82	\N	For starters, many people struggle with the hands-overhead position required in triceps extensions. "Some have a hard time standing straight up without flaring their ribs when they bring their arms overhead," Summers says.\n\nThis difficulty may be related to limited shoulder mobility, a common issue that can reduce your shoulders' range of motion, thus making it challenging to straighten your arms above you without discomfort. Consequently, attempting a move like the overhead triceps extension exacerbates the problem and can create new pain points.\n\n"Usually what happens with people who lack shoulder and thoracic [upper back] mobility is they start to compensate in other ways by jutting their neck out of alignment or overarching their lower back," Summers says.\n\nIn other words, putting your already weak shoulders in a vulnerable position can lead to injury in them as well as your neck and back. This scenario becomes especially troublesome if you misjudge your strength and lift too heavy.	t	0	2	Tricep Extension	\N	0	tricep-extension.jpg	4198400	4194304	f	f	1	0	t	\N	27	\N	\N	768

1671	\N	\N	t	0	2	Side-Lying Shoulder Flexion	This exercise, among others, was found by Cools et al (2007) to display the best muscle activation ratios in which the upper trapezius activation is minimized whereas the middle and lower trapezius activation is maximized. The prone and side-lying positions decrease the upper trap's activation as a postural muscle. When you stand, the upper trap is more active as its working against gravity. Laying on your stomach or side eliminates the effects of gravity and can decrease excessive activation of the upper trapezius.\n\nShoulder and neck pain and dysfunction are among some of the most common complaints of the overhead athlete and desk bound worker alike. Recent research has shone light on the importance of the scapular muscles on shoulder/neck pain and dysfunction. The scapula serves as our shoulder's stable base. We need a strong and stabilized scapula in order for our shoulder joint to move properly. Proximal stability promotes distal mobility.\n\nWhen it comes to the scapular muscles, the 3-part trapezius muscle plays a extremely large role in providing this stable base. In those with shoulder/neck pain and dysfunction, it has been found that many times the upper traps are hyperactive whereas the middle and lower trapezius muscles show reduced activation. Along with insufficient serratus anterior activation, this quartet of dysfunctions can lead to decreased amounts of scapular upward rotation, external rotation, and posterior tilt - all specific scapular motions that are imperative to maintaining the subacromial space and preventing things like shoulder impingement and rotator cuff tendinopathy. Start with no weights as shown, then progress to dumbbells.	68719542272	front-raise.jpg	34368127040	0	t	f	1	129	\N	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIhv5K_VMAw	665	\N	\N	58247

334	dips-full.webp	\N	f	4	2	Parallel Dips	If you don’t use proper form, triceps dips are a risky exercise for your shoulders. Doing them in a sloppy manner places your shoulders at a higher risk of injury. According to the American Council on Exercise, dips exert substantial stress on the anterior deltoids. The problem is the shoulder, despite being a ball-and-socket joint, doesn’t have the stability that the hip joint has. When you dip, it compresses on the capsule of the shoulder joint and creates added shearing forces on the shoulders.	131073	full-dips.jpg	4108	0	f	t	1	0	t	https://www.hybridcalisthenics.com/parallel-dips	7	\N	90	61319

1670	shoulder-external-rotation.webp	\N	t	0	2	Side-Lying Shoulder External Rotation	Arm needs to be kept next to the body (use a towel under the arm for tactile feedback) and the shoulder needs to be kept down and back for this to be effective. This exercise, among others, was found by Cools et al (2007) to display the best muscle activation ratios in which the upper trapezius activation is minimized whereas the middle and lower trapezius activation is maximized. The prone and side-lying positions decrease the upper trap's activation as a postural muscle. When you stand, the upper trap is more active as its working against gravity. Laying on your stomach or side eliminates the effects of gravity and can decrease excessive activation of the upper trapezius.\n\nShoulder and neck pain and dysfunction are among some of the most common complaints of the overhead athlete and desk bound worker alike. Recent research has shone light on the importance of the scapular muscles on shoulder/neck pain and dysfunction. The scapula serves as our shoulder's stable base. We need a strong and stabilized scapula in order for our shoulder joint to move properly. Proximal stability promotes distal mobility.\n\nWhen it comes to the scapular muscles, the 3-part trapezius muscle plays a extremely large role in providing this stable base. In those with shoulder/neck pain and dysfunction, it has been found that many times the upper traps are hyperactive whereas the middle and lower trapezius muscles show reduced activation. Along with insufficient serratus anterior activation, this quartet of dysfunctions can lead to decreased amounts of scapular upward rotation, external rotation, and posterior tilt - all specific scapular motions that are imperative to maintaining the subacromial space and preventing things like shoulder impingement and rotator cuff tendinopathy. Start with no weights as shown, then progress to dumbbells.	0	shoulder-external-rotation.jpg	8454144	0	t	f	9	137	t	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5bPOsQbq7g	282	\N	\N	58247
